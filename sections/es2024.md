# ES2024

Quite a few things are nearly done, so who knows‚Ä¶

---

# E2024? `Array.fromAsync(‚Ä¶)` <span class="stage">stage 3</span>

We've had `Array.from(‚Ä¶)` since ES2015, that consumes any **synchronous iterable** to turn it into an actual array.

We'll likely get `Array.fromAsync(‚Ä¶)`, that does the same thing with **async iterables**.

```js
// Reads all STDIN (readable stream) lines into an array
process.stdin.setEncoding('utf-8')
const inputLines = await Array.fromAsync(process.stdin)
```

```js
// Let's remove trailing whitespace / LF / CR, while we're at it
process.stdin.setEncoding('utf-8')
const inputLines = await Array.fromAsync(process.stdin, (line) => line.trimEnd())
```

# E2024? Collection / iterator utilities <span class="stage">stage 3</span>

We're not going to stop processing data collections (and iterables in general) anytime soon, so we might as well have more tools in our standard toolbelt for this‚Ä¶

We're about to get many [**new `Set` methods**](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-set-methods#readme) (intersection, union, difference, disjunction, super/subset, etc.) and a ton of [**iterator helpers**](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-iterator-helpers#readme) (instead of having to roll our own generative functions for `take`, `filter` or `map`, for instance).

```js
function* fibonacci() { /* ‚Ä¶ */ }

const firstTens = new Set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])
const fibs = new Set(fibonacci().take(10))
const earlyFibs = firstTens.intersection(fibonacci) // => Set { 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 }
const earlyNonFibs = firstTens.difference(fibonacci) // => Set { 4, 6, 7, 9, 10 }
const evenFibs = earlyFibs.values().filter((n) => n % 2 === 0)
```

<Footnote>

Asynchronous versions are in the pipeline too, at stage 2 right now (September 2023).

# Array grouping üéâ <span class="stage">stage 2</span>

One more nail in Lodash's coffin.

```js
const schedule = [
  { label: 'Morning run', time: '07:00', type: 'break' },
  { label: 'Welcome back!', time: '09:40', type: 'keynote' },
  { label: 'Life is a Mystery', time: '10:00', type: 'talk' },
  { label: 'Morning Break', time: '10:50', type: 'break' },
  { label: 'Design Beyond Breakpoints', time: '11:05', type: 'talk' },
  // ‚Ä¶
]
schedule.group(({ type }) => type)
// {
//   break: [{ label: 'Morning Run'‚Ä¶ }, { label: 'Morning Break'‚Ä¶ }],
//   keynote: [{ label: 'Welcome Back!'‚Ä¶ }],
//   talk: [{ label: 'Life is a Mystery'‚Ä¶ }, { label: 'Design Beyond Breakpoints'‚Ä¶ }],
// }

schedule.groupToMap(({ type }) => type)
// => Same thing, **as a Map** (so any grouping key type!)
```

# ES2024? Guaranteed resource cleanup <span class="stage">stage 3</span>

Finally a mechanism to guarantee resource disposal!

Quite like C#'s `using`, Python's `with` or Java's try-with-resources: disposes of the resource in a guaranteed way when the scope or closure is discarded.

Exists in synchronous and asynchronous variants.  Based on two new well-known symbols (`Symbol.dispose` et `Symbol.asyncDispose`), supported out-of-the-box by timers and streams.

```js
async function copy4K(s1, s2) {
  using f1 = await fs.promises.open(s1, constants.O_RDONLY),
        f2 = await fs.promises.open(s2, constants.O_WRONLY)

  const buffer = Buffer.alloc(4096)
  const { bytesRead } = await f1.read(buffer)
  await f2.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead)
} // 'f2' is disposed first, then 'f1' is disposed second
```

<Footnote>

The proposal is titled *Explicit Resource Management*. TypeScript 5.2 and Babel 7.22 support it, by the way.

</Footnote>

# ES2024? Import / export attributes <span class="stage">stage 3</span>

Provides free-form metadata on imports, with an inline syntax.

The dominating use case, long discussed, is extra module types with matching type expectations for security reasons (a bit like HTTP's `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` response header).  We then use the `type` metadata, leveraged by engines.

```js
// Static imports
import config from '../config/config.json' with { type: 'json' }

// Dynamic imports
const { default: config } = await import('../config/config.json', { with: { type: 'json' } })
```

The spec suggests matching upgrades for Web Worker instantiation and HTML's `script` tag.

<Footnote>

This proposal supersedes the same-stage *JSON Modules* proposal, that used a more specific `assert` syntax.

</Footnote>

# ES2024: `v` flag for regexes

Allows for **nested classes** (classes represent possibilities for a single character match), which in turn allows **difference** and **intersection** of classes. Wicked cool.

Use the `v` flag instead of ES2015's Unicode flag (`u`) when you need that feature.

```js
// All of Unicode's decimal digits, except ASCII ones:
text.match(/[\p{Decimal_Number}--[0-9]]/gv)

// Equivalently:
text.match(/[\p{Decimal_Number}--\p{ASCII}]/gv)

// All Khmer letters (= Khmer Script + Letter Property)
text.match(/[\p{Script=Khmer}&&\p{Letter}]/gv)
```

# ES2024? More flexible named capture groups <span class="stage">stage 3</span>

Named capture groups are a major readability / maintainability boost for regexes, but an oversight in their initial spec prevented using the same group in multiple parts of an alternative.

It should have been ready for ES2023 but lacked some tests and a second native implementation.  Tests are done now and we're waiting for either v8 or Spidermonkey to jump the gun: this will very likely be part of ES2024.

```js
const year = dateText.match(/(?<year>[0-9]{4})-[0-9]{2}|[0-9]{2}-(?<year>[0-9]{4})/)?.groups.year
```

---

# ES2024? `Promise.withResolvers()` <span class="stage">stage 3</span>

A common pattern rolled by hand anytime we need access to promise outcome methods outside of the `Promise` constructor callback.  Pretty neat to avoid scope juggling and when working with event-based underlying APIs for our async processing.

```js
const { promise, resolve, reject } = Promise.withResolvers()
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Don't expose the outcome methods to your consumers! It's only there to simplify your implementation code!

# ES2024? Decorators <span class="stage">stage 3</span>

<!-- Certes, √ßa ne concerne que les gens qui font beaucoup de POO, et si la tendance  est √† la baisse en JS, de nombreux frameworks importants l'utilisent √©norm√©ment (mais du coup, ils ont tendance √† le faire en TypeScript). -->

This takes **forever**‚Ä¶  Went through a few false-starts, then we had to wrap the test suite, and now we're waiting for native implementations.  The spec is done, anyway, and TypeScript aligns with it.  This is a great way of doing AOP *(as are ES proxies, by the way)*.  The language provides the plumbing, and the community provides the actual decorators.

```js
class SuperWidget extends Component {
  @deprecate
  deauth() { ‚Ä¶ }

  @memoize('1m')
  userFullName() { ‚Ä¶ }

  @autobind
  logOut() {
    this.#oauthToken = null
  }

  @override
  render() { ‚Ä¶ }
}
```

# ES2024? Shadow Realms <span class="stage">stage 3</span>

This provides the building blocks for having full control of **sandboxed JS evaluation** (among other things, you can customize available globals and standard library elements).

This is a **godsend** for web-based IDEs, DOM virtualisation, test frameworks, server-side rendering, secure end-user scripts, and more!

```js
const realm = new ShadowRealm()

const process = await realm.importValue('./utils/processor.js', 'process')
const processedData = process(data)

// True isolation!
globalThis.userLocation = 'Freiburg'
realm.evaluate('globalThis.userLocation = "Paris"')
globalThis.userLocation // => 'Freiburg'
```
