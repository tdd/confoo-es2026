# JavaScript or ECMAScript?!

ECMA, TC39, ECMAScript and JavaScript

---

# ECMA and TC39

**ECMA** is an international standards body
(much like ISO, IETF, W3C or the WHATWG, for instance)

**ES = ECMAScript**. The official standard for JavaScript\*

**TC39** = Technical Committee 39. Caretaker of several standards:
ECMAScript (ECMA-262), Intl (ECMA-402), JSON (ECMA-404), etc.

<Footnote>

Which happens to be, for the U.S., a registered trademark of Oracle Corp. I know. 🤢

# How TC39 moves JavaScript forward

Meets every two months (remote, in-room, hybrid)

**Yearly release cycle:** feature-freezing in January or March, official release in June.

“ES6” = ES2015, “ES7” = ES2016, and we now say ES2024, etc.

This is all [transparent and public](https://github.com/tc39).
